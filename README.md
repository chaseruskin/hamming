# `hamming`

## Overview

A generic VHDL implementation for encoding and decoding of the error-correction hamming code.

The implementation uses the "extended" hamming-code, where the 0th bit is an additional parity check against the entire data block for double-error detection (DED). The hardware is described in strictly _combinational logic_.

A single erroneous bit can be corrected for each hamming-code block (SEC). Any block received with an even number of errors `e` with `e` > 0 will not be valid. A block received with an odd number of errors `e` with `e` > 1 may self-correct to the incorrect original message.

`PARITY_BITS` | Block size | Data size  | Rate  
---     | --- | --- | --- 
2       | 4   | 1   | 1/4 = 0.250
3       | 8   | 4   | 4/8 = 0.500
4       | 16  | 11  | 11/16 ≈ 0.688
5       | 32  | 26  | 26/32 ≈ 0.813
6       | 64  | 57  | 57/64 ≈ 0.891
7       | 128 | 120 | 120/128 ≈ 0.938
8       | 256 | 247 | 247/256 ≈ 0.965

> __Note:__ `PARITY_BITS` does not account for the 0th extended parity bit. It is implicitly added to the block size.
